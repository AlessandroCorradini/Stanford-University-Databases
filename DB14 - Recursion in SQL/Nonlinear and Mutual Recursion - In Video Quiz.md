# Nonlinear and Mutual Recursion - In-Video Quiz

## Q1 

Suppose we have a graph consisting of exactly one linear path, encoded in a set of tuples Edge(A,B,cost): (node1,node2,c1), (node2,node3,c2), (node3,node4,c3), ..., (nodeM,node(M+1),cM). We use a recursive query to compute the total cost from node1 to nodeM. If M=1000, roughly how many iterations are needed for the linear versus nonlinear versions of the query?

- 1000 versus 500
- 1000 versus 100
- **1000 versus 10**
- 500 versus 10
